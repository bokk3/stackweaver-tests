# Arch Linux uses /usr/bin/python (not python3)

# Configure become settings
ansible_become_method=sudo

# IMPORTANT: Sudo password configuration
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Configure passwordless sudo on the target host:
#   On the target host, run: sudo visudo
#   Add line: sysadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#   Then Ansible will auto-detect passwordless sudo
#
# Option 2: Provide sudo password (if StackWeaver supports extra vars):
#   Uncomment and set: ansible_become_password=your_password_here
#   Or use StackWeaver's credential/variable system if available
#   Or use ansible-vault to encrypt the password securely
# ansible_become_password=your_password_here
